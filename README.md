# AFF4 -The Advanced Forensics File Format

The Advanced Forensics File Format 4 (AFF4) is an open source format used for the storage of digital evidence and
data.

It was originally designed and published in [1] and has since been standardised as the AFF4 Standard v1.0, 
which is available at https://github.com/aff4/Standard. This project is a work in progress implementation, 
providing two library implementations, C/C++ and Python.

## What is currently supported.

The focus of this implementation at present is reading images conforming with the 
AFF4 Standard v1.0. Canonical images are provided in the AFF4 Reference Images github 
project at https://github.com/aff4/ReferenceImages

1. Reading ZipFile style volumes.
2. Reading striped ZipFile volumes.
2. Reading AFF4 Image streams using the deflate or snappy compressor.
3. Reading RDF metadata using both YAML and Turtle.
4. Verification of linear and block hashed images.
5. Writing ZipFile style volumes.

## What is in progress

1. Logical file acquisition.

 ## What is not yet supported:

The write support in the libraries is currently broken and being worked on. Other aspects of 
the AFF4 that have not yet been implemented in this codebase include:

1. Reading ZipFile style volumes.
2. Reading striped ZipFile volumes.
3. Reading AFF4 Image streams using the deflate or snappy compressor.
4. Reading RDF metadata using both YAML and Turtle.
5. Verification of linear and block hashed images.
6. Writing ZipFile style volumes
7. Appending to ZipFile volumes

## Notice

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just
code that happens to be owned by Google and Schatz Forensic.
